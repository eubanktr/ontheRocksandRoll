Title: On the Rocks and Roll

Description: As a user, I want to begin venturing outside after lockdown, but I need help planning a schedule to do so. I want an application which helps me know 
            which events are in my area along with a beverage to make either before or after the night out. I would like to search by location for different types
            of events as well as have a 21 and over display for younger users.
            
User Story:
          1) As a user, I want to input my zipcode and be shown events in that area.
          2) As a user, I want to be shown events in the next several days with the most recent one shown first, along with the ability to filter by genre
          3) As a user, I want to be recommended a corresponding post or pre-event beverage based on the type of event. 
          4) As a user, if I accidentally input an incorrect zipcode, I want to be notified to correct it.
